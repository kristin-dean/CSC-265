<h1>Hello Web</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Daniel and I am writing about myself. 
  The thing that drives me is learning cool stuff about computers. Recently I started using various
  Linux distributions until I find enjoyable but I hopped around about 20 times. My poor hard drive
  I first tried straight Ubuntu</p>
  
<p>But I don't really like the interface on that one so I went to Mint, which was neat but they
  update security very rarely, so I went to Arch which took 4 hours and was really difficult so 
  I stopped doing that and then I started</p>
  
  <p>Using KDE Neon built on Ubuntu 18.04 which is a really good fit right now</p>
