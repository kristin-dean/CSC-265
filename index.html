<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>My name is Kristin Dean and my cause is my mother. My mom is the hardest-working and powerful woman 
  I have ever met in my life and continues to be my inspiration and motivator every day. I can only hope to grow up to be 
  like her someday and I notice our similarities more and more as I grow older.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious traits that my mom and I share are our academic interests. When I came to Centre and took math and 
  computer science classes, I almost immediately knew I wanted to be a math major and computer science minor. Once I had decided 
  this, I called my mom to let her know and that's when I found out she majored and minored in the exact same subjects when she was 
  in college! I really enjoyed learning this because it made me feel like her, something I try to achieve every day.</p>
<p>Another reason I picked my mother to be my "cause" was due to her ability to overcome adversity with a smile. My mom was 
  diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time in 2004, and then for the second time in 2010. While raising my five siblings 
  and me and working a full-time job at Procter & Gamble, she overcame both of these challenges, even when she was broken down. This 
  is why breast cancer research and data is a huge interest of mine and I am extremely lucky to have an internship this summer working in 
  the Ohio State University Bioinformatics Department, working with breast cancer data and working with the R language to put this 
  data into visualizations. This is also why I want to use breast cancer as my "cause" for data research!</p>
